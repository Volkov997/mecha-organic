### airflow components

none of the fans on ali have pressure/airflow information ðŸ˜­
probably something like this https://a.aliexpress.com/_EuHVSgW
or this https://www.amazon.de/ARCTIC-S12038-8K-120x120x38-reguliert-Anschluss/dp/B09VGS3LND/
also i need a pressure sensor up to 20mmWC / 5kPa, gonna use the BMP280 (extremly overkill precision but very cheap)

### making a test flute

Since the first one didnt work (i messed up how a flute works T.T), i made one that just uses a premade glass tube as a resonator .
ill probably use a 3d printed socket and a wooden resonator tube in the final design aswell. also i looked at some 3d printed flute designs on thingyverse
